Usage(or tips)
==============
FIRST: Enter in RAILS_ROOT and load vim.

Taglist usage(very very useful): 
	Current directory should be rails_root
	Push F8 (show taglist window) and then push F7 (procesing tags).
	Then you have a window with all relevant RoR files to access them or their methods.

GetLatestVimScripts:
  With :GLVS command should update all your plugins (some are installed others only downloaded).
	You should find configuration file at .vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat (plain text file)

NERD_tree:
	It's configured to show/hide with F9 key.

allml:
	Useful when you're editing *ml files.
	In ERB files I use the shortcuts:
		   " Mapping       Changed to   (cursor = ^)
			 " <C-X>=        foo<%= ^ %>
			 " <C-X>-        foo<% ^ %>
			 " <C-X>'        foo<%# ^ %>         (mnemonic: ' is a comment in ASP with VBS)
			 " <C-X><Space>  <foo>^</foo>
			 " <C-X><CR>     <foo>\n^\n</foo>
	Read allml.vim to find other shortcuts.

fuzzyfinder_textmate:
	\t	FuzzyFinder textmate mode
	\b	FuzzyFinder buffer mode
	\f	FuzzyFinder files mode
  leader = \

matchit:
	Matching "%"
